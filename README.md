# Telemetry for Rust APIs

> You can't fix what you can't see

![workshop](workshop.jpeg)

Your Rust application has finally been deployed to production! Nice! But is it working?  
This workshop will introduce you to a comprehensive toolkit to detect, troubleshoot and resolve issues in your Rust APIs.

You will be working through a series of test-driven exercises to learn Rust while building up your Rust observability toolkit!

This workshop is designed for people who have basic familiarity with Rust as a language and want to learn more about
Rust's observability story.  
If you run into any issue with the assumed level of Rust knowledge, please ping us and we'll sort it together!

## Requirements

- **Rust** (follow instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).  
  If Rust is already installed on your system, make sure you are running on the latest compiler version (`cargo --version`).  
  If not, update using `rustup update` (or another appropriate command depending on how you installed Rust on your system).
- _(Optional)_ An IDE with Rust autocompletion support.
  We recommend one of the following:
    - [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/);
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [`rust-analyzer`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer) extension.  

## Getting started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mainmatter/rust-telemetry-workshop.git
cd rust-telemetry-workshop

# Our `workshop-runner` CLI, you will need it to work through the exercises. 
# You can run `wr --help` to check that everything is running properly
cargo install workshop-runner

# Work on your solution in a branch. 
git checkout -b my-solution

# Get started!
wr
```

Follow the instructions shown in the terminal to get started with the first exercise.

Run this command from the top-level folder
```bash
wr
```
to verify your current solutions and move forward in the workshop.

Enjoy!

## Solutions

You can find the solutions to the exercises in the [`solutions` branch](https://github.com/mainmatter/rust-telemetry-workshop/tree/solutions) of this repository.

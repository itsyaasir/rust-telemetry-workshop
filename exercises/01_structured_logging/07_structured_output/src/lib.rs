//! # Structured output
//!
//! In all our exercises (and tests), we've been looking at the emitted diagnostics for a
//! single invocation of an instrumented function.
//! In the real world, however, we can expect to have hundreds if not thousands of invocations
//! per second, each of which will emit its own diagnostics and might result in a different
//! outcome.
//!
//! In order to make sense of all this data, we need to be able to **analyze it**.
//!
//! We might want to know, for example, how many failures we have had in the last hour. Queries
//! can also get more complex: how many failures have we had in the last hour, broken down by
//! error type and by user?
//!
//! So far we've always been looking at a single line of text which interpolates the target of
//! the span, the values of our fields and other metadata (e.g. timing) into a human-readable string.
//! That kind of representation is not very amenable to machine processing.
//!
//! In order to answer those questions, we need to be able to **structure** our output.
//!
//! The simplest data format we can use is JSON.
//!
//! # Exercise
//!
//! Change the subscriber settings to output JSON instead of plain text.

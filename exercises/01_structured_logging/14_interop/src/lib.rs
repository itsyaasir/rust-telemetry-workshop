//! # Interoperability
//!
//! You have seen first-hand how much `tracing` brings to the table.
//! Nonetheless, migrating an entire ecosystem takes time: you can still find crates that rely
//! on `log` for instrumentation.
//!
//! We need a way to bridge the gap between the two worlds: you should be able to use a single
//! pipeline to process telemetry coming from both sources.
//!
//! # `tracing-log`
//!
//! The `tracing-log` crate can act as such a bridge: it provides you with a `log`-compatible
//! processor which redirects all `log` events to `tracing`.
//!
//! Be mindful: if you're using `tracing_subscriber::fmt` as your `tracing` subscriber, it'll
//! automatically install this bridge for you unless you explicitly disable the `tracing-log`
//! feature.
//!
//! # Exercise
//!
//! We have explicitly disabled the `tracing-log` feature in `tracing-subscriber` in our
//! `Cargo.toml`.
//! Use the `tracing-log` crate to manually re-route logs emitted via `log` to `tracing`â€”the
//! process you'll need to go through if you're a difference subscriber for `tracing`.
